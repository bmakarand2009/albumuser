installs the zip from myalbum plugin
Note; This is not working with the template present in the mylabum plugin.

I have tried various approaches to get this plugin work but it does not, here are the approaches

   <g:render template="album/tracks" model="[theTracksToRender:album.tracks]" plugin="myalbum"/> 

   <g:render template="album/tracks" model="[theTracksToRender:album.tracks]" contextPath="${pluginContextPath}"/>
